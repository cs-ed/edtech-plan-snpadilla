# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Ed Tech plan is to prepare for a year of online instruction with middle school students in an indepedent program within a public school district. The students will be taking an Introduction to Computer Science course along with their core academic subjects.

## Context

### Course

The course will be Introduction to Computer Science for students in grade 6. This course will cover a block based visual programming language through [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu) and a general purpose programming language called Python. The teacher will guide the students through the provided curriculum in [projectstem.org](projectstem.org). From [projectstem](projectstem.org), the students will link onto [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu) to complete their activities for the first two blocks of this course. During the last two blocks of the course, they will link onto [code.org](code.org). This course is based on Pass/Fail grading, with credit given to students if they earn 60% or higher overall in their assignments, projects, and quizzes.

By taking this course, the students will be prepared to take more advanced classes in computer science at the high school level with these fundamental skills in their background. Moreover, computer science skills will also transfer to other areas in the student's academic and personal life. Through debugging, the students will learn problem solving skills, patience, and persistence. While programming, students will consider the process of writing code in a logical manner and will soon learn to add layers of complication by including simultaneous computations through the idea of parallelism.

### Situation

The [Alhambra Virtual Academy](https://www.ausd.us/apps/news/article/1469087) was established in July of 2021 to support our indepedent studies students in Grades TK to 8 throughout the Alhambra Unified School District (AUSD). [AUSD](http://www.ed-data.org/district/Los-Angeles/Alhambra-Unified) itself serves a population of slightly over 16,000 students in a suburban area about 8 miles east of Downtown, Los Angeles. It sits at the western edge of the San Gabriel Valley. Approximately 50% of students are of Asian descent, while 41% of students are Hispanic or Latino. Sixty-three percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunch and 27.3% of students are English Learners. 

The program supports families with medically fragile students by providing an online program that uses the same curriculum as their in-person counterparts with a similar schedule. This program is unique since many local school districts do not have an independent studies program that provides 100% virtual learning. Daily, there are 4 hours of synchronous instruction and 2 hours of asynchronous instruction. Currently, there are about 1,000 students in the program, which results in 2 to 5 sections of classes per grade level. All instructors were either district certificated employees who volunteered to teach in this program or newly hired teachers to support this virtual program. 

Each middle school teacher has an option of teaching their own specialty for Universal Access, which is considered an elective course that supports all learners. For this program, Mrs. Padilla has chosen to teach Introduction to Computer Science to her class of 29 students. Since the Alhambra Virtual Academy provides all students with a Chromebook, the obstacle of having a device for each students is eliminated. Moreover, Mrs. Padilla received a sponsporship for Amazon Future Engineers so the curriculum is at no cost to the school district.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

1. [Netop](https://www.netop.com/) - this software is installed in each district issued Chromebook. Once it is enabled, it provides a live view of the student's screen. Should the teacher suspect off-task behavior, the teacher can access the student's screen and redirect any inappropriate behavior.
2. [Google Suite for Education](https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?gclid=CjwKCAiAs92MBhAXEiwAXTi254dITYXeRe_WOJkAHNEopV7PVug-0kP1JylS-UAWsjaimLy3ZxZz-BoCFzoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#%2Fready-to-go) - the teacher will load assignments and instructional material on to Google Classroom. Students will often use Google Slides and Google Forms to complete some assignments as well.
3. [projectstem.org](projectstem.org) - this will be the main website that the students will access. The website provides the lessons for the students. It also aids the teacher in managing the pacing of the curriculum and provides teacher resources in implementing the curriculum.
4. [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu) - the teacher will create user names and unique passwords on [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu). Students will add their work to the correct studios so that the teacher can easily access completed work.
5. [code.org](code.org) - After the second block of instruction provided by projectstem.org, the students will join [code.org](code.org) to begin programming in Python.
6. [PowerSchool](family.ausd.us) - this is the student information system (SIS) software used at AUSD. Families can check attendance, grades, and other records through this site. 
7. [Zoom](zoom.us) - virtual students will receive daily synchronous instruction through Zoom. Zoom allows chats, screensharing, and breakout rooms for group work.
8. [Grade Transferer](https://www.gradetransferer.com/) - this is a browser extension that "grabs" grades from sites such as Google Classroom and transfers them over to an SIS such as PowerSchool. It is a time saving tool for teachers.

### Application

Since this class is taught virtually, the provided hardware is critical for student success, especially in a school district with 63% of families qualifying for free or reduced lunch. With the Chromebook provided, students are able to log on to Zoom to receive vital teacher instruction and peer to peer interactions. At the same time, the device is able to handle having a couple of other applications running at the same time without causing too much lag while on Zoom. This is important since students will be required to access assignments in Google Classroom and open up links to their curriculum websites during their synchronous instruction. 

At the beginning of each class, the teacher will provide a recap of the previous lesson by using the Screenshare feature on Zoom. Then during the main instruction, the teacher will guide the students through the lesson by playing the short videos from the projectstem.org curriculum. Often times, the teacher will pause the screen, use the annotate button, and mark on the screen to point out key points or important details that the students should look out for during their work time. After providing instruction, the students will link onto the [projectstem.org](projectstem.org) website using the system allocated usernames and passwords. On projectstem, the students will review their tasks and go on to [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu) to complete their activities during the first two blocks of the curriculum. In the future, they will continue on to [code.org](code.org). Since the teacher is unable to see students working in real time while they are on the projectstem website or while they go on to their independent work on [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu), the teacher has the option to turn on the Netop software, which enables the teacher to view the individual student's desktop. This is possible as long as the students are using Google Classroom. By using this, the teacher is able to redirect the student to correct their behavior or off-task activity.

Some of the projects require pair programming while others are individual-based activities. Either way, programming is best learned by exploring and by collaborating with other students. With that in mind, the teacher opens up automatically assigned breakout rooms for activities that do not require a dedicated partnership for a specified length of time so that students can collaborate. If the assignment requires a dedicated partner, then the teacher will either pre-assign breakout rooms with the group number requirement of the activity or will allow the students to choose their breakout rooms. The screenshare feature is turned on so that students can share out in their breakout rooms. This is why it is important for each student to have a working camera and a computer that can handle more than one application at a time. Moreover, the audio capabilities are vital so that the students can hear the teacher and their classmates.

Each class period is 50 minutes long so assignments are not always completed during that time allotment; however, students are given until the next class meeting to complete their activities (this class meets on Mondays and Thursdays). 

With the [projectstem](projectstem.org) curriculum, the students are given a quiz mid-unit and a project to complete at the end of the unit. Each unit consists of 10 lessons. Although the quizzes are automatically graded, the teacher needs to input the grades onto Google Classroom so that the student and their parents can see feedback on their quiz. As students complete their projects in [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu), they add their work to the class studio for that lesson. Since these lessons are to provide the students practice for their culminating project at the end of the unit and to prepare them for their quiz, the assignments are given credit or no credit. The evidence used for the student's final grade will be the quiz and final project. Students must also present their final project to the class for each unit as part of their grade. Grades are then transferred from Google Classroom to PowerSchool through the use of the Grade Transferer software. Once the grades are transferred, the parents can go to the Parent Portal in PowerSchool and check their child's grade.

### Impacts

For the teacher and the students, this is the second year attending school online. Although it may not be the choice that the student desired, their family believes for medical reasons that this is the best option for their family. Learning from the past, students who had limited access to computers, the internet, or peripherals that can best support their ability to receive quality instruction fell behind their peers who had access to those resources. 
Through this independent studies program, which is 100% virtual for students in TK - 8th grade, the students are each provided a district Chromebook, which can be exchanged for servicing if technical issues arise. In addition, students who lack access to the internet may apply for a district issued hotspot. If requested, since some families may have more than one child in attendance, the district will also provide headsets with noise cancelling capabilities.
All curriculum is provided virtually so that families do not need to make arrangements to pick up school material; however, if the families request hard copies of any of the instructional material, then the district will make an arrangement for those requests. This also eliminates to the need for families to print any paperwork or instructional material.
