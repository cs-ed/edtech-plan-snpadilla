# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Ed Tech plan is to prepare for a year of online instruction with middle school students in an indepedent program within a public school district. The students will be taking an Introduction to Computer Science course along with their core academic subjects.

## Context

### Course

The course will be Introduction to Computer Science for students in grade 6. 
### Situation

The Alhambra Virtual Academy was established in July of 2021 to support our indepedent studies students in Grades TK to 8 throughout the Alhambra Unified School District (AUSD). AUSD itself serves a population of slightly over 16,000 students in a suburban area about 8 miles east of Downtown, Los Angeles. It sits at the western edge of the San Gabriel Valley. Approximately 50% of students are of Asian descent, while 41% of students are Hispanic or Latino. Sixty-three percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunch and 27.3% of students are English Learners. 

The program supports families with medically fragile students by providing an online program that uses the same curriculum as their in-person counterparts with a similar schedule. This program is unique since most local school districts do not have an independent studies program that provides 100% virtual learning. Daily, there are 4 hours of synchronous instruction and 2 hours of asynchronous instruction. Currently, there are about 1,000 students in the program, which results in 2 to 5 sections of classes per grade level. All instructors were either district certificated employees who volunteered to teach in this program or newly hired teachers to support this virtual program. 

Currently, there are 4 sections in grade 6. Of the 4 classes, 3 of these classes rotate following the in-person middle school schedule. This is a block schedule, with each subject meeting twice a week. Each teacher is required to teach ELA, PE, and Universal Access. As for the remainder of their teaching schedule, each teacher will only teach one other subject (Social Studies, Science, or Math), in which they will teach to the other classes. For example, one teacher may be the dedicated 6th grade Math teacher and will teach this subject to all 3 classes. Another unique feature of this program is that each teacher has an option of teaching their own specialty for Universal Access, which is considered an elective course that supports all learners. For this program, Mrs. Padilla has chosen to teach Introduction to Computer Science. Since the Alhambra Virtual Academy provides all students with a Chromebook, the obstacle of having a device for each students is eliminated. Moreover, Mrs. Padilla received a sponsporship for Amazon Future Engineers so the curriculum is at no cost to the school district.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
